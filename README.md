Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning in Python 

The project aimed to use machine learning (ML) to predict the signal that indicates
whether buying a particular stock would be beneficial. I utilized various libraries and
tools, such as NumPy for efficient computation, Pandas for loading the data into a 2D
array format, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Sklearn for data prepro-
cessing, model development, and evaluation. In particular, the team employed XGBoost,
an eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm known for its high accuracy in
making predictions
